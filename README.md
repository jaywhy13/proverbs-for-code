# Proverbs for Code

I've adopted this principle of concretizing lessons I've learnt by
assocating them with proverbs. I have been recently using ChatGPT
to provide proverbs once I explain the lesson I'm trying to internalize.

It's been a little tedious having to retype the prompt each time
for ChatGPT so I can get a proverb back, so I've opted to build a
little React app instead that takes the lesson and gets a list of
proverbs from ChatGPT.
